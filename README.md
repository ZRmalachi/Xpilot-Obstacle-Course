## Welcome to my Project Site!


For my Xpilot-AI project I am planning on creating an obstacle course or maze that a Genetic Algorithm will then learn how to navigate while carrying the ball from Capture the Flag without crashing or dropping the ball. I will first create a production system to progress through the course and then use a GA to learn the parameters. 

I plan on having different checkpoints set up for the agent to try to reach which will lead the agent through the course. Or, if I do a maze, it will just have an endpoint the agent needs to reach. I’m not sure how well it will learn a maze, so I will likely just stick to the obstacle course idea, I will do a bit of research into xpilot mazes to see if anything similar has been done before. 

I’m thinking of evaluating fitness by how many checkpoints it hits, how close it gets to the next checkpoint, and will possibly add some evaluation of the time it takes to complete to try to make it go through as quickly as possible.
